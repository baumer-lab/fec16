`fec16` contains candidate, committee and candidate-committtee linkage data for the United States 2015-2016 election cycle. To get an understanding of what leads to a win, we have various **a selection of x contributions??** contribution data along with state data of the election winners. 


## Installation

`fec16` is hosted on GitHub and call be installed by running the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ranawg/fec16")
```

``` r
library(fec16)
```

## Example

`fec16` can be used to summarise data in order see how many candidates are running for elections (in all offices) for the two major parties:
```{r example}
candidates %>% filter(cand_pty_aff == "REP"|cand_pty_aff =="DEM") %>% group_by(cand_pty_aff) %>% summarise(size = n())
```

A data wrangling example that uses two of the data frames could be:
```{r}
cand_cmte <- full_join(candidates, committees, by = "cand_id") %>% filter(cand_pty_aff == "REP"|cand_pty_aff =="DEM") %>% group_by(cand_pty_aff, committee_type) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% drop_na(committee_type)
cand_cmte
```

And extending that to create a visualisation to see the results easily.
```{r}
ggplot(cand_cmte, aes(x = committee_type, y = n, fill = cand_pty_aff)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Bar Chart of Total Committees by Type and Party", x = "Committee Type", y = "Count", fill = "Candidate Party Affiliation")
```


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
